# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Karaoke Video Renderer is a web-based application that enables users to create professional karaoke videos by combining video files with synchronized subtitle effects. The application features a client-server architecture designed to handle videos of any length without memory limitations, providing real-time preview capabilities and multiple rendering engines for optimal performance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to upload video files to the server, so that I can process karaoke videos without browser memory limitations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a video file (MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV) THEN the system SHALL upload it to the server for processing
2. WHEN a video upload is initiated THEN the system SHALL display upload progress with file size and transfer rate
3. WHEN a video upload completes THEN the system SHALL return a unique video ID for subsequent operations
4. IF a video upload fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with retry options
5. WHEN the server receives a video THEN it SHALL validate the format and extract metadata (duration, resolution, frame rate)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to import subtitle files with word-level timing, so that I can create synchronized karaoke effects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user imports a JSON subtitle file THEN the system SHALL parse word-level timing data for karaoke highlighting
2. WHEN a user imports subtitle data THEN the system SHALL validate timing consistency and text content
3. WHEN subtitle parsing fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages with line numbers
4. WHEN no subtitle file is provided THEN the system SHALL allow manual subtitle creation through the timeline editor
5. WHEN subtitle data is loaded THEN the system SHALL display it in the timeline editor for modification

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time preview capabilities in the browser, so that I can see karaoke effects before final rendering.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user plays the preview THEN the system SHALL render effects using HTML5 Canvas at full resolution
2. WHEN the user scrubs the timeline THEN the system SHALL provide frame-accurate seeking with subtitle preview
3. WHEN the user applies effects THEN the system SHALL show instant preview without server processing
4. WHEN the user modifies subtitle timing THEN the preview SHALL update in real-time
5. IF preview rendering fails THEN the system SHALL display error messages while maintaining interface responsiveness

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a subtitle editor, I want comprehensive text editing capabilities, so that I can precisely control karaoke content, timing, and appearance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a subtitle line THEN the system SHALL allow direct text content modification
2. WHEN a user adjusts timing controls THEN the system SHALL update start/end times with drag functionality and numerical input
3. WHEN a user selects multiple subtitle lines THEN the system SHALL enable batch timing adjustments
4. WHEN a user modifies word-level timing THEN the system SHALL support precise karaoke synchronization
5. WHEN a user saves edits THEN the system SHALL update the preview immediately and prepare data for server rendering

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to apply visual effects to karaoke text, so that I can create engaging and professional-looking videos.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects text styling options THEN the system SHALL provide font family, size, weight, color, and positioning controls
2. WHEN a user applies karaoke effects THEN the system SHALL support highlight modes (word-by-word, character-by-character)
3. WHEN a user adds visual enhancements THEN the system SHALL provide glow, shadow, border, and background effects
4. WHEN a user combines multiple effects THEN the system SHALL support effect layering with proper rendering order
5. WHEN a user creates effect combinations THEN the system SHALL allow saving and loading as reusable presets

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want server-side rendering with multiple performance modes, so that I can generate high-quality videos efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates server rendering THEN the system SHALL provide multiple rendering modes (Ultra-Fast, Parallel, Real-time)
2. WHEN a user selects rendering settings THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of resolution, frame rate, and quality
3. WHEN server rendering is in progress THEN the system SHALL display real-time progress via WebSocket with frame count and ETA
4. WHEN rendering completes THEN the system SHALL provide download link with automatic file cleanup after 24 hours
5. WHEN rendering fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages and allow job cancellation

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive web interface, so that I can efficiently navigate between preview, editing, and rendering functions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a responsive web interface with video preview, timeline editor, and effects panel
2. WHEN a user interacts with the video preview THEN the system SHALL provide playback controls with timeline scrubber
3. WHEN a user accesses the effects panel THEN the system SHALL show categorized effect controls with real-time parameter adjustment
4. WHEN a user works with the timeline editor THEN the system SHALL provide subtitle line management with drag-and-drop timing adjustment
5. WHEN a user performs any operation THEN the interface SHALL remain responsive and provide appropriate visual feedback

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want memory-optimized processing, so that I can render videos of any length without crashes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing long videos THEN the server SHALL use file-based streaming to prevent memory issues
2. WHEN rendering frames THEN the system SHALL process in batches of 100 frames maximum in memory
3. WHEN temporary files are created THEN the system SHALL automatically clean them up after processing
4. WHEN multiple jobs are running THEN the system SHALL limit concurrent processing to 3 jobs maximum
5. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL implement garbage collection and provide memory usage monitoring

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want reliable job management, so that I can track, cancel, and manage multiple rendering operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a rendering job is created THEN the system SHALL assign a unique job ID and queue it for processing
2. WHEN jobs are queued THEN the system SHALL process them in order with configurable concurrency limits
3. WHEN a user requests job status THEN the system SHALL provide current progress, estimated completion time, and detailed status
4. WHEN a user cancels a job THEN the system SHALL stop processing immediately and clean up temporary files
5. WHEN jobs complete or fail THEN the system SHALL maintain job history and provide download links for successful renders

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want modular rendering engines, so that I can optimize performance for different use cases and hardware configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL provide multiple rendering engines (memory-optimized, parallel, GPU-accelerated, batch processing)
2. WHEN a rendering mode is selected THEN the system SHALL use the appropriate engine with optimized settings
3. WHEN hardware capabilities vary THEN the system SHALL automatically select the best available rendering engine
4. WHEN new rendering techniques are developed THEN the system SHALL support adding new engines without breaking existing functionality
5. WHEN performance monitoring is needed THEN each engine SHALL provide metrics for processing speed and resource usage
