- **Error Handling**: Extensive error scenario testing

## Files Created/Modified

### Source Code

- `src/models/data_models.py` - Enhanced with comprehensive data models
- `src/services/audio_file_service.py` - New audio file validation service

### Tests

- `tests/test_models/test_data_models.py` - Comprehensive data model tests
- `tests/test_services/test_audio_file_service.py` - Audio service tests
- `tests/test_integration/test_audio_integration.py` - Integration tests

## Next Steps

The core data models and audio file validation are now complete and ready for use by other components. The next logical tasks would be:

1. **Task 3**: AI model management system
2. **Task 4**: Audio processing pipeline (Demucs/WhisperX integration)
3. **Task 5**: Subtitle generation system

All components are designed to work together seamlessly with proper error handling and validation throughout the pipeline.
