# Task 7.1 Summary: Create Batch Processing Queue and Controller

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive batch processing system for handling multiple audio files with queue management, progress tracking, and error handling.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components Implemented

#### 1. BatchProcessor Class (`src/services/batch_processor.py`)

- **File Queue Management**: Add, clear, and validate audio files in processing queue
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates across multiple files with callbacks
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error recovery and continuation for failed files
- **Cancellation Support**: Ability to cancel batch processing mid-operation
- **Status Reporting**: Detailed status information for queue and individual files

#### 2. Supporting Data Classes

- **BatchFileItem**: Represents individual files in the queue with status tracking
- **BatchFileStatus**: Enum for file processing states (pending, processing, completed, failed, cancelled)
- **BatchProcessingState**: Manages overall batch processing state and progress calculation

### Key Features

#### Queue Management

- Add multiple audio files to processing queue
- Validate file formats (.mp3, .wav, .flac, .ogg)
- Skip invalid or non-existent files with logging
- Clear queue when not processing
- Prevent modifications during active processing

#### Progress Tracking

- Overall batch progress percentage calculation
- Individual file progress callbacks
- Estimated time remaining based on completed files
- Real-time status updates with descriptive messages

#### Error Handling and Recovery

- Continue processing remaining files when individual files fail
- Detailed error messages for failed files
- Graceful handling of processing exceptions
- Comprehensive error logging

#### Processing Control

- Sequential file processing (foundation for future concurrent processing)
- Cancellation support with proper cleanup
- Thread-safe operations with locking
- Processing state management

### API Interface

#### Main Methods

```python
# Queue Management
add_files_to_queue(file_paths: List[str]) -> None
clear_queue() -> None

# Processing Control
process_batch(options: ProcessingOptions) -> BatchResult
cancel_processing() -> bool

# Progress Tracking
set_progress_callback(callback: Callable[[float, str], None]) -> None
set_file_progress_callback(callback: Callable[[str, float, str], None]) -> None

# Status Reporting
get_processing_status() -> ProcessingStatus
get_queue_status() -> Dict[str, Any]
```

#### Progress Callbacks

- **Overall Progress**: `(progress_percentage: float, status_message: str)`
- **File Progress**: `(file_path: str, progress_percentage: float, operation: str)`

### Integration Points

#### Audio Processor Integration

- Uses existing `AudioProcessor` for file validation and processing
- Delegates vocal separation and transcription to audio processor
- Handles audio processor progress callbacks

#### Subtitle Generation Integration

- Placeholder for subtitle generator integration
- Generates output file paths based on processing options
- Supports multiple export formats

### Testing

#### Unit Tests (`tests/test_services/test_batch_processor.py`)

- **26 comprehensive test cases** covering all functionality
- Data class validation and behavior testing
- Queue management operations
- Processing workflows (success, failure, mixed results)
- Progress tracking and callbacks
- Error handling and recovery
- Cancellation scenarios

#### Integration Tests (`tests/test_integration/test_batch_simple.py`)

- End-to-end batch processing workflow
- Real file handling with temporary files
- Mock audio processor integration

### Requirements Fulfilled

#### Requirement 6.1: Multiple File Processing

✅ **WHEN multiple files are selected THEN the system SHALL queue them for sequential processing**

- Implemented file queue with `add_files_to_queue()` method
- Sequential processing in `_process_files_sequentially()`

#### Requirement 6.2: Progress Tracking

✅ **WHEN batch processing is active THEN the system SHALL display overall progress and current file status**

- Real-time progress calculation with `progress_percentage` property
- Current file tracking with `current_file_path` and `current_file_index`
- Progress callbacks for UI integration

#### Requirement 6.3: Error Recovery

✅ **WHEN a file in the batch fails THEN the system SHALL continue processing remaining files and report errors**

- Individual file error handling in `_process_files_sequentially()`
- Error message storage in `BatchFileItem.error_message`
- Continued processing despite individual failures

### Performance Characteristics

#### Memory Management

- Efficient queue management with minimal memory overhead
- Proper cleanup of temporary files and resources
- Thread-safe operations with appropriate locking

#### Processing Efficiency

- Sequential processing prevents resource contention
- Progress tracking with minimal performance impact
- Optimized status reporting and callbacks

#### Scalability

- Foundation for future concurrent processing implementation
- Configurable `max_concurrent_files` parameter (currently set to 1)
- Extensible architecture for additional processing options

### Future Enhancements

#### Concurrent Processing

- Framework in place for multi-threaded file processing
- `ThreadPoolExecutor` infrastructure ready for activation
- Configurable concurrency levels

#### Advanced Queue Management

- Priority-based processing
- Queue persistence across application sessions
- Batch processing templates and presets

#### Enhanced Progress Tracking

- More granular progress reporting
- Processing speed metrics
- Resource utilization monitoring
