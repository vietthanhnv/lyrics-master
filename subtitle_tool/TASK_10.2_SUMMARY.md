# Task 10.2: First-Run Setup and Model Initialization - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive first-run setup system for the Lyric-to-Subtitle App that guides users through initial configuration, system requirements checking, and AI model downloads.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. First-Run Wizard (`src/ui/first_run_wizard.py`)

- **Multi-step wizard interface** with 4 pages:

  1. Welcome & System Requirements Check
  2. Model Selection & Configuration
  3. Model Download with Progress Tracking
  4. Setup Completion & Summary

- **System Requirements Checker** that validates:

  - Python version compatibility (3.9+)
  - Available disk space (2GB+ required)
  - System memory
  - FFmpeg availability
  - GPU support detection (CUDA/Metal)

- **Model Download Worker** with:

  - Asynchronous model downloading
  - Real-time progress tracking with speed and ETA
  - Download resumption support
  - Cancellation support
  - Error handling and retry logic

- **Configuration Management**:
  - Model size selection (tiny/base/small/medium/large)
  - Output directory configuration
  - Settings persistence

### 2. Configuration System Updates (`src/utils/config.py`)

- **First-run detection** with `first_run_completed` flag
- **Setup version tracking** for future migrations
- **System readiness checking** methods:
  - `is_first_run()`: Detects if this is the first application run
  - `needs_setup()`: Checks if setup is required
  - `mark_setup_completed()`: Marks setup as finished

### 3. Application Controller Integration (`src/services/application_controller.py`)

- **System readiness validation**:

  - `_check_system_readiness()`: Validates system state on startup
  - `get_required_models()`: Determines needed AI models
  - `check_models_availability()`: Verifies model availability
  - `is_ready_for_processing()`: Comprehensive readiness check

- **Setup guidance system**:
  - `get_setup_guidance()`: Provides actionable setup recommendations
  - Missing model detection and reporting
  - System requirement validation integration

### 4. Main Application Integration (`src/main.py`)

- **Conditional startup flow**:
  - Automatic first-run wizard display when `config_manager.needs_setup()` returns `True`
  - Direct main window launch for normal operation
  - Proper signal handling between wizard and main window

### 5. Comprehensive Testing

- **Unit tests** for system requirements checker
- **Integration tests** for configuration management
- **UI tests** for wizard functionality
- **Mock-based testing** for model management
- **Demo script** for manual validation

## Technical Features

### User Experience

- **Progressive disclosure**: Step-by-step guidance without overwhelming users
- **Visual feedback**: Clear progress indicators and status messages
- **Error recovery**: Graceful handling of failures with user guidance
- **Cancellation support**: Users can cancel setup at any time
- **Responsive UI**: Non-blocking operations with progress updates

### System Integration

- **Offline-first design**: Works without internet once models are downloaded
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Windows, macOS, and Linux support
- **Resource management**: Proper cleanup of temporary files and downloads
- **Configuration persistence**: Settings saved across application restarts

### Error Handling

- **Network failures**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Disk space issues**: Pre-download validation and user notification
- **Model corruption**: Integrity checking with re-download capability
- **System requirements**: Clear messaging for unmet requirements

## Files Created/Modified

- `tests/test_integration/test_first_run_integration.py` - Integration tests
- `test_first_run_demo.py` - Manual testing and validation script

### Modified Files

- `src/utils/config.py` - Added first-run detection and setup tracking
- `src/services/application_controller.py` - Added system readiness checking
- `src/main.py` - Integrated first-run wizard into startup flow
- `src/services/translation_service.py` - Fixed syntax errors for proper imports
